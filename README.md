# VSCode Coding Time Tracker

This VSCode extension tracks the amount of time you spend coding.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT ⚠️

I most likely wont be maintaining/updating this extension in the future, as it is an old project. I original used this as a way to learn how to make vscode extensions. Even so, I decided to finish a working version to finally give this project some closure.

### Progress - Not Done

This extension is still in development however version 0.1.0 (finally) is currently available.
Keep in mind I am a student and have other projects so I am unable to work on this constantly.

## Installation

Simply download the extension from the marketplace and enjoy!
